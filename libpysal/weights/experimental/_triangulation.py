def delaunay(coordinates, ids=None, bandwidth=numpy.inf, kernel="boxcar"):
    """
    Constructor of the Delaunay graph of a set of input points.
    Relies on scipy.spatial.Delaunay and numba to quickly construct
    a graph from the input set of points. Will be slower without numba,
    and will warn if this is missing.

    Parameters
    ----------

    coordinates :  numpy.ndarray, geopandas.GeoSeries, geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        geometries containing locations to compute the delaunay triangulation.  If
        a geopandas object with Point geoemtry is provided, the .geometry attribute
        is used. If a numpy.ndarray with shapely geoemtry is used, then the
        coordinates are extracted and used.  If a numpy.ndarray of a shape (2,n) is
        used, it is assumed to contain x, y coordinates.
    ids : numpy.narray (default: None)
        ids to use for each sample in coordinates. Generally, construction functions
        that are accessed via W.from_kernel() will set this automatically from
        the index of the input. Do not use this argument directly unless you intend
        to set the indices separately from your input data. Otherwise, use
        data.set_index(ids) to ensure ordering is respected. If None, then the index
        from the input coordinates will be used.
    bandwidth : float (default: None)
        distance to use in the kernel computation. Should be on the same scale as
        the input coordinates.
    kernel : string or callable
        kernel function to use in order to weight the output graph. See the kernel()
        function for more details.

    Notes
    -----
    The Delaunay triangulation can result in quite a few non-local links among
    spatial coordinates. For a more useful graph, consider the weights.Voronoi
    constructor or the Gabriel graph.

    The weights.Voronoi class builds a voronoi diagram among the points, clips the
    Voronoi cells, and then constructs an adjacency graph among the clipped cells.
    This graph among the clipped Voronoi cells generally represents the structure
    of local adjacencies better than the "raw" Delaunay graph.

    The weights.gabriel.Gabriel graph constructs a Delaunay graph, but only
    includes the "short" links in the Delaunay graph.

    However, if the unresricted Delaunay triangulation is needed, this class
    will compute it much more quickly than Voronoi(coordinates, clip=None).

    For a link (i,j) connecting node i to j in the Delaunay triangulation
    to be retained in the Gabriel graph, it must pass a point set exclusion test:

    1. Construct the circle C_ij containing link (i,j) as its diameter
    2. If any other node k is contained within C_ij, then remove link (i,j)
       from the graph.

    clip : str (default: 'bbox')
        An overloaded option about how to clip the voronoi cells passed to cg.voronoi_frames()
        Default is ``'extent'``. Options are as follows.

        * ``'none'``/``None`` -- No clip is applied. Voronoi cells may be arbitrarily larger that the source map. Note that this may lead to cells that are many orders of magnitude larger in extent than the original map. Not recommended.
        * ``'bbox'``/``'extent'``/``'bounding box'`` -- Clip the voronoi cells to the bounding box of the input points.
        * ``'chull``/``'convex hull'`` -- Clip the voronoi cells to the convex hull of the input points.
        * ``'ashape'``/``'ahull'`` -- Clip the voronoi cells to the tightest hull that contains all points (e.g. the smallest alphashape, using ``libpysal.cg.alpha_shape_auto``).
        * Polygon -- Clip to an arbitrary Polygon.
    contiguity_type : str (default: 'v')
        What kind of contiguity to apply to the voronoi diagram. There are three
        recognized options:
        1. "v" (Default): use vertex_set_contiguity()
        2. "r": use rook() contiguity
        3. "q": use queen() contiguity (not recommended)

    Notes
    -----
    In theory, the rook contiguity graph for a Voronoi diagram
    is the delaunay triangulation of the generators of the
    voronoi diagram. Yet, this is *not* the case when voronoi
    cells are clipped to an arbitrary shape, including the
    original bounding box of the input points or anything tighter.
    This can arbitrarily delete links present in the delaunay.
    However, clipped voronoi weights make sense over pure
    delaunay triangulations in many applied contexts and
    generally will remove "long" links in the delaunay graph.
